Setting Up a Local Sidechain
============================

A local sidechain is a sidechain where all the federators are running on one machine, such as a laptop.
This setup is useful for when you're playing around with sidechains or testing some sidechain code that you have.
This is not a production-ready sidechain; go to the other tutorial for how to set up a production-ready sidechain.


Setting up environment variables
--------------------------------

Follow the ``.env.example`` and README instructions.


Setting up config files
-----------------------

Run ``sidechain-config``


Starting up a sidechain
-----------------------

Run ``sidechain-launch --shell``
